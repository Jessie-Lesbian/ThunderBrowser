# ThunderBrowser
ThunderBrowser is an extremely lightweight, simple and high-performance but quite restricted browser made by Jessie Lesbian all by herself.
## build
simply enter this into a .net SDK shell
```
csc /target:winexe /checked /optimize /out:ThunderBrowserV1.0.1_X64-86.exe libthunderbrowser.cs
```

## VS google chrome
ThunderBrowser uses 1/4-1/8 less RAM than Google Chrome but it's JavaScript engine is very very crappy.
